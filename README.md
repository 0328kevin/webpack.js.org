## Contributing

To develop, please pull the project, `cd` into the directory and run:

- `npm install` to pull all dependencies.
- `npm run build` to create a production version of the site.
- `npm run dev-server` to develop on a local webpack-dev-server (should be [here](http://localhost:8080/)).
