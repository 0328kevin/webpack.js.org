## Webpack.io

Guides, documentation, and all things Webpack.

## Contributing

To develop, please pull the project, `cd` into the directory and run:

- `npm install` to pull all dependencies.
- `npm run build` to create a production version of the site.
- `npm start` to develop on a local webpack-dev-server (should be [here](http://localhost:3000/)).

#### Git Flow

We are using the [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model. Please direct all pull requests for code changes to the [develop](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.io/tree/develop) branch. [Content](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.io/tree/master/src/content) changes are fine on to make on master.

#### Editor Config

The [.editorconfig](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.io/blob/develop/.editorconfig) in the root should ensure consistent formatting. Please make sure you've [installed the plugin](http://editorconfig.org/#download) if your text editor needs one.
