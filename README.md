## Contributing

To develop, please pull the project, `cd` into the directory and run:

- `npm install` to pull all dependencies.
- `npm run build` to create a production version of the site.
- `npm start` to develop on a local webpack-dev-server (should be [here](http://localhost:3000/)).

If you want to fetch the documentation on additional loaders/plugins hosted in [separate repositories](https://github.com/webpack), run `npm run fetch`.
