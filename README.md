## Webpack.io

Guides, documentation, and all things Webpack.

## Contributing

To develop, please pull the project, `cd` into the directory and run:

- `npm install` to pull all dependencies.
- `npm run build` to create a production version of the site.
- `npm run dev-server` to develop on a local webpack-dev-server (should be [here](http://localhost:8080/)).

### Git Flow

We are using the [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model.

### Editor Config

The [.editorconfig](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.io/blob/develop/.editorconfig) in the root should ensure consistent formatting. Please make sure you've [installed the plugin](http://editorconfig.org/#download) if your text editor needs one.
